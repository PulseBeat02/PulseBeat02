Hello everyone, I am a **Java** activist and I love programming my projects using the language. I also have learned other languages such as **HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript**, and some **Python**. I am the owner of the King Mammoth Sole Proprietership (Organization), and also I am involved in other organizations such as **Ponclure**, a small group of developers who likes creating Minecraft Plugins using the Spigot API, mods using the Forge/Fabric API, as well as datapacks/resourcepacks/worlds which are used in our projects. Some projects that I have included in my portfolio include:
