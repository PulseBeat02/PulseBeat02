### Hey, I'm Brandon 👋

I'm a software engineer intern at [Google](https://www.google.com/) mostly working on the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) video player.

In my free-time, I work on my open-source projects you can see pinned below. I also have a [portfolio website](https://brandonli.me/) 📝 that contains a lot of the things that I make. 🤯
