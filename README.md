### **Hello, I'm PulseBeat_02**

![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=PulseBeat02.PulseBeat02)

I am a **Java** activist and I love programming my projects using the language. I have learned languages such as **HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript**, and some **Python**. I am avid algorithmic programmer as [well](https://github.com/PulseBeat02/Competitive-Programming) who loves solving problems from the USACO, Advent of Code, and Foo Bar. I am currently in <span style="color:blue">Gold</span> division for the USACO.

Aside from competitive programming, I am the owner of the King Mammoth, and also involved in other organizations such as **Ponclure** (a small group of developers who likes creating Plugins using the Spigot API, mods using the Forge/Fabric API, as well as datapacks/resourcepacks/worlds).
